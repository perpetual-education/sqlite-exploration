# SQLite exploration

Apparently... you can just make a file - and it's a database... and it's already built into PHP. But The docs are not very friendly or clear.

* PDO overview (introduction) https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php
* setAttribute() method https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.setattribute.php
* PDO attributes and constants https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.constants.php
* PDO error modes https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.error-handling.php
* SQLite-specific PDO docs https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php

Take some time to look at that. Were you able to create a database and access it yet?

On a scale from 1-10, how easy would it be for a your average developer to figure this out?
